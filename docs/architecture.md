# Architecture

High-level overview of how Uni Pasco Hub is structured and how requests flow through the system.

## Runtime boundaries

### Server-only

- All `src/app/api/` route handlers
- `src/lib/db.ts`, `src/lib/pascos.ts`, `src/lib/cloudinary.ts`, and most of `src/lib/`
- Prisma queries and Cloudinary SDK calls

### Client (`"use client"`)

- Form components, engagement bar, file viewer
- TanStack Query hooks and API client (`src/lib/api/client.ts`)
- Auth gates (`PascoCreateGate`, `PascoEditGate`)

### Shared

- Zod schemas (`src/lib/schemas/`)
- Type definitions (`src/types/api/`)
- Display helpers (`src/lib/catalog-labels.ts`, `src/lib/pasco-file-types.ts`)

## Middleware and public routes

[`src/proxy.ts`](../src/proxy.ts) runs Clerk middleware on all routes except Next.js internals and static files. All page routes are public at the proxy layer; sign-in is enforced in UI gates and API handlers where needed.

**Public at the edge** (no `auth.protect()`):

- `/api/webhooks`
- `/api/institutions`, `/api/programs`, `/api/courses` (and sub-routes)
- `/api/pascos` (and sub-routes)

**Protected at the edge** (`auth.protect()` required):

- `/api/users/*`
- `/api/cloudinary/sign`
- `/api/admin/*`

Many public routes enforce authentication inside the handler for mutations (e.g. `POST /api/pascos` requires a contributor). This allows anonymous browsing of catalog and pasco listings while keeping write operations gated.

## Key design decisions

### Clerk for auth + local User row for roles

Clerk handles sign-in, sessions, and identity. A `User` row in PostgreSQL stores app-specific data: `role`, `school`, and relations to pascos and engagement. Users are synced via webhooks and an SSR fallback component.

### Cloudinary for file storage

Files are uploaded directly to Cloudinary via a signed widget flow. Assets are stored under `pascos/{courseId}/` folders. The database stores metadata (`publicId`, `fileUrl`, `contentHash`) but not file bytes.

### Content-hash duplicate detection

Each file is fingerprinted with SHA-256 before pasco creation. Duplicates are rejected at upload time and again at create time to prevent the same exam paper from being uploaded twice.

### Signed URLs for view and download

Raw Cloudinary URLs are not exposed for viewing or downloading. The API returns time-limited signed URLs after auth and rate-limit checks.

### Storage cleanup logging

When Cloudinary assets fail to delete (during pasco update/delete or orphan cleanup), failures are persisted in `StorageCleanupFailure` for admin inspection. Batch orphan scans are logged in `StorageCleanupRun`.

## Data flow: create pasco

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Form as PascoCreateForm
  participant API as API Routes
  participant DB as PostgreSQL
  participant CL as Cloudinary

  User->>Form: fill metadata + upload files
  Form->>API: POST /api/cloudinary/sign
  Form->>CL: upload via widget
  Form->>API: POST /api/pascos/files/compute-hash
  Form->>API: POST /api/pascos/files/check-duplicates
  Form->>API: POST /api/pascos
  API->>CL: verify assets
  API->>DB: create Pasco + PascoFiles
  API-->>Form: 201 pasco
  Form-->>User: redirect to /pascos/[id]
```
